    <p>Walk the red carpet. Feel the thrill of a 100+ mph lap around the track. Watch fireworks and sip cocktails from the Pagoda. Dance the night away on the finish line of the legendary Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p>
    <p>Rev 2018 will bring together the finest food, catchiest tunes and fastest IndyCar drivers in one place for a night you won't forget.</p>
    <p>And you can enjoy it all while supporting IU Health statewide trauma and critical care programs. These funds provide care for drivers and patrons at the IU Health Emergency Medical Center located at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and for patients across Indiana in need of critical care.</p>
