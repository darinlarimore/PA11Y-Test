    <p>Rev brings together food, fun and a night of celebration to kick off the greatest month in racing. The best part, though, is that it's all for a good cause. Funds raised support IU Health statewide trauma and critical care programs. These funds provide care for drivers and patrons at the IU Health Emergency Medical Center located at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and for patients across Indiana in need of critical care.</p>

      <p>Each year, Rev raises support for IU Health trauma and critical care programs throughout Indiana and also to advance the care provided at the IU Health Emergency Medical Center at IMS. Funds go toward equipment and training to keep patrons and drivers safe during a race.</p>
      <p>IU Health trauma and neurological trauma services, Lifeline and Gary Brackett's Gotcha Covered Program are programs that also benefit from funds raised at Rev. Rev 2017 proceeds helped acquire AEDs, Moberg CNS monitors, TEG machines, nurse and physician training, emergency fire suits and helmets and a new Mobile Intensive Care Unit last year.</p>

      <p>IU Health Methodist Hospital and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway have a relationship dating to the racetrack’s earliest days and, like the Indianapolis 500, are poised to move forward for years to come. From the hospital’s first motorized ambulance in 1910 to the first liftoff of the IU Health LifeLine helicopter in 1970 to today, IU Health Methodist Hospital and IMS have worked together to promote the safety of race car drivers and Hoosiers alike. As we approach the 102nd Running of the Greatest Spectacle in Racing, Rev is a celebration of the continued partnership between these influential Hoosier institutions.</p>
